## How To

* Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
* Get a baking pan. Line it with foil for easy cleanup.
* On top of the baking pan, put each fish fillet on top of a square of foil large enough that you'll be able to wrap it up like a packet later.
* Sprinkle fish fillets on both sides with olive oil.
* Sprinkle fillets on both sides with salt, pepper, and herbs.
* Pour a little wine over the top of each fillet.
* Chop up garlic finely.
* Sprinkle garlic over the top of each fillet.
* Thinly slice the lemons into disks.
* Place lemon disks on top of fish, so each fillet is covered in a lemon disk blanket.
* Wrap up the fillets into individual foil packets.
* Put in oven for about 25 minutes.
