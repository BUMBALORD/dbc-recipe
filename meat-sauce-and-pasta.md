## Meat Sauce and Pasta

Make a big pot of quick, easy, fresh meat sauce. Mix it up with pasta and bring individual tupperwares to DBC to microwave on-site.

## Ingredients

1 pound of ground meat (Beef, pork, turkey, lamb, whatever you want.)
2-3 stalks of celery
A generous handful of fresh basil leaves (Use dried if you don't have any.)
A handful of fresh parsley
1 white or yellow onion
4 - 8 cloves of garlic (your call)
Olive oil
3 - 4 cans of diced tomatoes (I like Hunt's brand)
A box of pasta (I like penne, rigatoni, or linguini)
Balsamic vinegar (optional)
Red cooking wine (optional)
Parmesan or Romano cheese (optional)

## To Do

* Chop up the celery, basil, parsley, onion, and garlic into small pieces.
* Put olive oil in large pot on stove on medium heat.
* When it's hot, add garlic and onions, stirring often. Wait until the garlic starts to brown a little and the onions start to get a bit clear.
* Add the meat in small chunks to the pot. Stir often. Brown the meat, but don't worry about cooking it all the way through.
* Add diced tomatoes and stir once.
* Add celery, basil, and parsley, stir once. Turn heat down to low.
* Go do some coding homework for about 20-30 minutes, getting up to stir once or twice.
* Taste the sauce. What does it need? Balance out the flavor with a splash of vinegar or red cooking wine. Let it simmer a little longer for the taste to develop.
* When you're almost done, adjust with salt and pepper.
* You can stir in parmesan/romano cheese at the last moment for a richer taste.
* Serve over pasta.

# Notes

The longer you let the sauce simmer, the better it will taste. This is great for weekend coding homework. Get up and stir on Pomodoro breaks!
